    "# Adaptive Growth Model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a large variety of models to explain the **growth of clusters structures** observed in nature, like bacterial colonies, snowflakes formation or deposition of materials. One of the best known models, and simplest one, is the **Eden growth model**, which describes the cluster growth by random accumulation on the boundary of the material. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Eden model, one can imagine starting from an initial particle (seed) in a two dimensional lattice. Cluster growth occurs by, at every time interval, an empty site of the surroundings is occupied by a new particle and connected to the initial particle. Then, after a time interval, new sites are available (the neighboring sites) and a new site is occupied by another particle, at random. The clusters generated by this model is found to be compact, with few holes in the inner regions. Moreover, this model shows an irreversible growth, since the particles are not allowed to be removed from the cluster and it will grow indefinitely, so it is far from satisfactory. Nevertheless, the Eden model provides a basis to understand cluster growth in a simple manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to allow a **steady state** in the cluster growth, new models have been created and studied. One of the most important is the known as **adaptive growth model**, which finds it basis on the original Eden model. We discuss the model in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The model\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is based on the work of **Paul Meakin** [ P. Meakin: An Eden model for the growth of adaptive networks,\n",
    "Physica A 179, 1991].\n",
    "\n",
    "The **adaptive growth model** can be simulated as follows: starting from an initial particle (**seed**), one of its nearest neighbors is selected at random and filled with a new particle, as in the Eden model. However, in this model, we include an additional variable, $\\sigma_{i}$, which is associated to each particle in the cluster. After an unoccupied site has been chosen and filled with a new particle, we compute the **path** between the new particle and the seed of the cluster. Then, we increase the variable $\\sigma_{i}$ associated with each particle forming the path by a certain amount $\\delta_{i}$, given by \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\delta_{1}=\\frac{1}{\\left(1+l\\right)^{\\eta}}\n",
    "\\label{eq:score1} \\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where *l* is the **length of the path** and $\\eta$ is an arbitrary number, usually taken as 1. Once we have added $\\delta_{1}$ to each particle of the path, we decrese by an amount of $\\delta_{2}$ the variable $\\sigma_{i}$ of all particles of the cluster. This quantity is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\delta_{2} = \\frac{1}{N_{m}}\n",
    "\\label{eq:score2} \\tag{2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where *$N_{m}$* is a parameter of the model. Then, if $\\sigma_{i}$ for a given particle is **less than zero**, the **particle** is **removed** from the cluster. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of the variable $\\sigma_{i}$ as a **score** associated to each particle in the cluster, as it measures the **participation** of the particle in the growth process. It is also a measure of how “old” is a particle of the cluster, as the oldest ones are more likely to have a higher score. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before continuing with the results, we are going to discuss how to compute the path between the newly added particle and the seed. In this case, we are trying to find the **shortest path** between both particles. One could use a shortest path algorithm such as breadth-first search (BFS) or Dijkstra's algorithm. However, this approach is computationally costly and, for large clusters, it is needed a lot of time to run a simulation. Thus, in this work, we have used another method, which is as follows. After a new particle is added, we assign one of the neighbors of the particle as the “parent”. In this case, we can think of the particles as nodes. Since the cluster growth starts with the initial seed, each node of the cluster will be connected to the seed in such a way that in order to find the shortest path one has to follow the parent-parent network for a specific node to finally arrive at the seed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we add particles one at a time, we can use the total numbers of particles added as a measure of time. Keep in mind that, because in this model we can remove particles, the total number of particles added is not the same as the size of the cluster. In fact, most of the particles added were eventually removed. \n",

    "    \n",

    "The central particles tend to be a higher score than the outer ones. In the earlier stages of the growth, the particles near the seed tend to be rewarded with a higher score, as a consequence of expression $\\ref{eq:score1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of this type of clusters does not growth ndefinitely. Instead, after a long time, it reaches a steady regime in which the size oscillates around a fixed value. Now, we will see the differences between the clusters when we change the parameter $N_{m}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can see that in the earlier stages of the growth process, the number of particles increases linearly in both clusters. However, we can see that the cluster with the parameter fixed at $1600$, its size stops at around $470$. In contrast, the cluster with the parameter $N_{m}=102400$ continues the growing process until reaching the size of $\\thicksim7700$. At the time of $2.5\\cdot10^{5}$ both clusters have reached the steady state regime. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is exactly at $t>2.5\\cdot10^{5}$ when we can see the adaptive nature of the model, as we can see that when switching the parameters of the clusters, their size change in order to adapt to the new parameter. In fact, we can see that the cluster with the initial parameter fixed at $1600$, “rapidly” adapts to the new parameter and reaches again the stationary size, at $\\sim7700$ particles. However, in the case of the second cluster, the adaptive period is much larger as it takes until $t>10^{6}$ to reach the steady state at  $\\sim470$. \n",

    "In order to study the dependence of the size of the cluster with the parameter N_{m} we will simulate the size evolution in time for multiple values of the parameter.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can observe an interesting behaviour: the size of the cluster (in the steady state) seems to be proportional to the parameter $N_{m}$. So, we can plot the size of the clusters in the steady state, $s(\\infty)$,  vs the values of $N_{m}$ used in the previous figure, and fit the data with a linear regression. To calculate $s(\\infty)$ we use the mean of the number of particles during the last 10000 steps of the simulation, as we assume that the cluster has reached a stationary regime.\n",
